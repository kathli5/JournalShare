    <h2>My first hackathon!</h2>
    <h4>Saturday, 13 November 2022</h4>
    <h4> Feeling: Happy 😁 </h4>
    <p>
      Today I am at Whackathon! It is my first hackathon and I am feeling excited. My group is making a website and we have been learning a lot. I am a little stressed but in a good way.

   <h4>Learning New Things</h4>
<p>I have learned literally so much so far. I learned how to code buttons and I learned about a sausage fest party happenning at Olin tonight. I love WHACK 😍
